## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
  - For Univariate Visualization:
    - During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for some numeric datatype columns. 
    - Also, a barplot was visualized for some categorical columns.
  - For Multivariate Visualization:
    - A heatmap was plotted to get a perspective of the correlations between the numeric columns.
    - Scatterplots and barplots were used to explore some feature relations.

### Explanatory Data Analysis
Features were separated into 3 categories:
  - Categorical
  - Ordinal
  - Numeric

For each feature:
  - A univariate plot was explained.
  - A multivariate plot with the target was explored

### Some highlighted insights explored from the data:
  - The maximum retal price for items affects the items outlet sales strongly. As when the price increase, the item outlet sales are expected to increase.
